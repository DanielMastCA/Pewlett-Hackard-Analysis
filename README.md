As we can see by the table above, a total of 16981 positions need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact".

##### 2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Based on the ~72,000 staff retiring in the next few years, only 1,549 staff are eligible to mentor. If we go by the assumption that all of these employees are accepting the mentorship job offer, and that the ~72,000 staff retire within a 3 year timeframe as per the analysis, and each mentor is assigned to mentor new staff for 1 year per new hire, the mentors would need to mentor **~16** new hirers per year, for 3 years, to make up for the ~72,000 new positions. Depending on the position and department needs, this number can be quite high, and may not give the new hires enough time to be mentored by the retirement-ready employees.
